# Web based music player

This is a simple app for playing music from the browser.

The backend is written in Flask.

## TODOs

[*] Add `mediaSession` for better media notification controls on android.
[] Add more than one playlist.
[*] `localStorage` for keeping track of current song (which song, time, etc.)
